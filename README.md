# NebulaLE (Nebula Low Energy)

This is a follow up project that continues development of Nebula, Monte Carlo simulator for electron-matter interaction. 
The main simulator repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Nebula-simulator/Nebula).
The documentation for the simulator can be found [here](https://nebula-simulator.github.io).

The focus of this version is to improve the physics models of the low energy range < 500 eV, with special focus between 0 and 100 eV.
